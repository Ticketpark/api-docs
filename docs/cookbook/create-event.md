# How to create a new event

This is the basic workflow how to create a new event over the api.


## 1. Create a venue

If you don't have a venue yet, create one.

```
POST https://api.ticketpark.ch/venues/
```

```json
{
	"host": "{pid of your host}",
	"name": "Hallenstadion",
	"city": "ZÃ¼rich"
}
```

Hint
{: .label }
In the response look for the `Location` header field to get the newly created pid.


Then add sectors to your venue.

```
POST https://api.ticketpark.ch/sectors/
```

```json
[
{
	"host": "{pid of venue from above}",
	"name": "Tribune A",
	"price_category": 1,
	"capacity": 1000
},
{
  	"host": "{pid of venue from above}",
  	"name": "Tribune B",
  	"price_category": 2,
  	"capacity": 500
}
]
```
